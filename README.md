# kidney-status-and-update-backend-
Made a simple backend http server using Express.js/postman/node.js
emulating a hospital where we can see / update / delete our no. of unhealthy/healthy kidneys in the server which has a internal  small 1-person database 
( it is simply a backend and you can only make changes if u fork the code and change it there " there is no frontend to this code as of yet , will be updating it soon  ")
